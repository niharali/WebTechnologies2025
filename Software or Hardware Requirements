Software/Tools Used: 
1. AngularJS: A structural framework for dynamic web applications.
2. Java Development Kit (JDK): Provides the necessary tools and libraries for Java development.
3. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans for writing and managing Java code.
4. Database Management Systems (DBMS): Such as Oracle, MySQL or PostgreSQL for JDBC operations.
5. Apache Tomcat: A web server and servlet container to run and test Servlets and JSP applications.
6. Maven or Gradle: Build automation tools for managing project dependencies and building Java projects.
7. Web Browsers: For testing and running AngularJS applications.
8. Version Control Systems: Such as Git for source code management and collaboration.
18.Hardware/Devices Used:
1. Personal Computers (PCs) or Laptops: For development, testing, and running the applications. Ideally, these should have at least:
   - Processor: Dual-core or higher (Intel i5/i7 or AMD Ryzen 5/7)
   - RAM: 8GB or more
   - Storage: SSD for faster performance
2. Servers: Physical or virtual servers may be used to deploy and test web applications, especially when dealing with Servlets and JSP. These could include:
   - Local development servers (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP)
   - Remote cloud servers (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
3. Network Devices: For connectivity and testing network-related features.
   - Routers and Switches
   - Network cables and Wi-Fi adapters
4. External Storage Devices: Such as USB drives or external hard disks for backing up code and database files.

5. Monitors: Dual monitors can enhance productivity during development by allowing simultaneous viewing of code and application output.
6. Input Devices: Standard keyboards and mice, with potential use of specialized input devices like graphic tablets for certain development tasks.
